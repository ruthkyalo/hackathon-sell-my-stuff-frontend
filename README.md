## 🏆 Hackathon Challenge

**Your Mission**: Deploy the complete infrastructure required to run this application using Terraform and GitHub Actions.

This hackathon is designed to help aspiring cloud engineers gain hands-on experience with:
- AWS infrastructure provisioning with Terraform
- CI/CD pipelines with GitHub Actions
- Static hosting with Amazon S3
- Content distribution with Amazon CloudFront
- Integration with Amazon API Gateway

## Backend Project

This is the frontend React application for the Sell My Stuff service. The backend API that powers this application can be found at:

- **Backend Repository**: [Sell My Stuff - Backend](https://github.com/breakintocloud/hackathon-sell-my-stuff-backend)

The backend provides AI-powered image analysis and generates professional product descriptions and price suggestions that are displayed in this frontend interface.

## Features

- 💰 Smart price suggestions based on item analysis
- 🔑 Secure API key authentication
- 📋 Copy-ready listing text for easy posting
- 🎨 Modern, responsive UI with drag-and-drop upload

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) in your browser.

### 4. Build for production
```bash
